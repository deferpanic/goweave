Aspect Oriented Programming for Go


### What's up with the Name?
I was going to name this the flaming neckbeard in honor of those who
after seeing this code or hearing about it would have their respective
beards spontaneously combust into flame.

Instead I named it after Goa, India where I went to relax after
GopherCon India back in February and hacked out deprehend. I see it as
an extension of that work.

The name sucks - suggest a new one.

### Why!??!
We came to go to get away from java!! I agree this concept can and has
been abused in the past. However, being able to do some of the things
you can do with this is just way too conveinent.

I'm definitely not a code purist - to me coding is a tool first and
foremost.

### Usage:

Where you might use

```go
  go build
```

simply replace with

```go
  goa
```
