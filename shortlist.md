### TODO - shortlist before opening up

* get rid of examples once regex stuff is completely moved over..

* remove the regex stuff
  -- need to port goroutine stuff

* remove the fset warnings by making sure we add imports correctly.

* transfer the rest of the examples to working tests
  -- ex1 is mostly done...
  -- ex2 .. ex4 needs to be converted to tests

* probably change the call/around advice in the http example
  -- right now it's just replacing - we want to show true around usage

* get go-routine coverage working differently (w/out regex?)

* break apart large tests into units
