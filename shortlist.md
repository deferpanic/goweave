### TODO - shortlist before opening up

* rename aop to weave

* some samples from readme:
  - logging
  - static validation

* get go-routines working w/out regex

* make our tests agnostic..

* probably change the call/around advice in the http example
  -- right now it's just replacing - we want to show true around usage

* break apart large tests into units
